# Nailspiration
## Purpose
* This is an app to catalog my nail polish collection. 
* The app will pull from my catalog of polishes, nail art tools, and techniques to randomely generate combinations of polishes and nail art.
* The app will inspire creative combinations and approaches I would not have thought of.
## Things to think about
### Base Functionality
* I would like to be able to export as a CSV format
* Polishes need to be catagorized by type (gel, regular, stamping)
* Polishes need to be catagorized by brand
* Polishes need to be catagorized by effect/type (holo, creme, flash reflective)
* I would like to save combo's and add photos of the final product
### Scalability
* Adding saving and account functonality would be nice
* Allowing the oppurtunity to share within the nail art community.
